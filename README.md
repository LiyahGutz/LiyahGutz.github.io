To be honest I have no idea what I'm truly doing
Because it has been awhile since I have experienced web development
It is a very challenging and daunting task
I tried doing the guided tasks, but I apologize that I haven't.... submitted yet.

Anyway, I have dabbled in grid styles in CSS in my personal website, since I want it to look like a dossier like one could see in some spy movie, like a file 
about a person and their information. Doing grids is kind of easy, because I can manipulate the divs with their width, by using the columns and rows. Although, it can be very difficult too, 
since when I tried to put an image in one of the grids, the borders does not.. like stick to the image, if you know what I'm saying, without changing the margins and gaps between the divs
CSS selectors, since I have class in every element in the html, so I select the element by their class.

What I have learned in the the previous learning tasks is like taking down the memory lane when I learned to develop a web, albeit the lane is full of rocky path. So there were probably like
the things that i have learned in the past, but had somehow forgotten about it. Unfortunately, I haven't submitted the exercises, because I'm not done with them yet :'(
Anyway, what I can do about improving the website, is that probably adding some animation? I don't where though. And probably flexbox? Where I could see the dossier using my phone, but grids
are totally tricky for me, so there may be some things that I don't know yet, since it's still difficult for me.

Okay thank you for reading, it has been a real pleasure to do this personal website, although I probably did this on a whim, I probably would like to improve it someday
